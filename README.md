# SMARS-Jarramplas
Traditional fectivity designed to be made on your closest makerspace. 

This robot is desing to be easy to make on any laser cutter or 3d printed. You need the structure, a SMARS with microbit (https://github.com/FabLab-Merida/Smars-con-Microbit) or any classic SMARS robot , some fabric and ping-pong balls with adhesive velcro. We painted and added stuff to ours to make it closer to the traditional one, but its better if you give it your touch.

Have fun builing, programing and making them, learning about Extremadura or just playing with it.
